# Vue.js + Laravel SPA + Vuetify: Simple Boilerplate

A very simple starter project with Laravel and Vue.js as a Single Page Application (SPA).

Designed is powered by [Vuetify framework](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) based on Material Design.

The goal is to start a new SPA project quickly with routes and components structure already in place.

__What's included:__

- Laravel 7 default project
- Vue.js boilerplate with Components: App, Header, Navbar, Footer, Sidebar
- Three menu items using Vue Router: Homepage (dynamic data from API), About and Contact (both static texts) 
- One Laravel model Product with Migrations+Seeds, one API call to get all products, using API Resource
